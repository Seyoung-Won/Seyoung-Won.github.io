* ["Climate Change and the US Macroeconomy: Time-Varying Parameter Approach with Stochastic Volatility"]((/files/Seyoung_Won_JobMarketPaper.pdf))

    This paper supplements the study of [Kim, Matthes and Phan (AEJ:Macro, 2025)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20220329) by employing a vector autoregression model with time-varying coefficients model so that the analysis about the impact of the climate change to the key US macroeconomic variables is available for all periods of data, not just the startpoint and the end of the periods. This paper endogenosuly finds the structural breakpoint of the Actuaries Climate Index (ACI) data and provides its importance in the impulse response analysis of inflation. 

    This research shows the evolution of the changing effects of a climate change shock to the growth in inflation, industrial production output, and unemployment rate from the periods 1975 to 2024. Inflation responses dampen more rapidly, yet the initial impact is larger later, output growth decreases immediately after the climate shock and excerbates over time. Unemployment tends to have its re-hiring process disappeared later.
