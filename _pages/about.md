Welcome to my page!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Washington on the 2025-2026 job market. 

My research interest lies in Applied Time Series Econometrics and Empirical Macroeconomics. My job market paper "_Climate Change and the US Macroeconomy: Time-Varying Parameter Approach with Stochastic Volatility_" studies the time-varying impacts of climate change index to the key macroeconomic variables of the United States: inflation, output and unemployment rate.
